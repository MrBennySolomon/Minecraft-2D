# Minecraft-2D

Minecraft is a sandbox video game initially created by Swedish programmer, Markus "Notch" Persson .
The creative and building aspects of Minecraft enable players to build constructions out of textured cubes in a 3D procedurally generated world.
In my version of the game, we will use a 2D pre- generated world (meaning, our world will be hardcoded).

1. The user will have 3 types of tools:

* Axe - for cutting trees
* Pickaxe - for mining rocks   
* Shovel - for digging dirt

2. Clicking on a tool followed by clicking on a tile in the
world will remove the tile. (If it is of the correct type
according to #1) and add it to the inventory.

3. Users can click on the tile in the inventory and place
it back in the world.
